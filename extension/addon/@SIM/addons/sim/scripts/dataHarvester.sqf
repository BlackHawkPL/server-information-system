// SIM_AAR DATA HARVESTER
// AUTHOR: VEROX
// NOTES:
//			Can we loop every unit THEN call the extension and pass the data?
//			Would this be faster?
//			Is there a limit to the string size we can pass?
// 			Can we loop a few times THEN send to the extension to get the best of both worlds?
//
//	TODO:	The SLEEP command needs to be variable, to take into account LOAD and PIPE messages passed back from the extension.

// We sleep to wait until mission start. No need to know movements at briefing.
sleep 1;

// Output to the RPT that we're starting.
